        <h2>Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH</h2>
        <p>BMW's history can be traced back to 1916, when the German government forced the merger of 
            Flugmaschinenfabrik Gustav Otto and Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke AG (BFW). The company's first product was aircraft engines 
            for World War I.
            The official founding date of the German motor vehicle manufacturer BMW is 7
             March 1916, when an aircraft producer called Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (formerly Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik)
              was established.[1][2] This company was renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, the BMW name dates back to 1917, when Rapp Motorenwerke changed its name to Bayerische Motoren Werke.[3] BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes.
              The major shareholder in BMW, Vienna based Italian speculator Camillo Castiglionli, sold all of his shares to Knorr
               Bremse in May 1920, who then acquired the remaining shares to make BMW a wholly owned subsidiary still run by Popp. Less 
               than two years later Popp persuaded Castiglionli buy back the BMW company name and buy the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke for it
                production site on the other side of the air field. There the company produced its first motorcycle in 1923. This was the
                 legendary Max Fritz designed BMW R32 shaft drive motorcycle, which featured an integrated gearbox, recirculating rather than 
              total loss lubrication and with the cylinder heads poking out for cooling.
